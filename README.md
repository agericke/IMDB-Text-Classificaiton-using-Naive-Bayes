# IMDB Text Classification using Naive Bayes From Scratch

This project implements a scrapping of IMDB for then implementing a classification algorithm using a Naive Bayes implementation from scratch instead of using an already implemented package.

This approach is made with the intention of digging into numpy, pandas and the theory behind the naive bayes implementation.

## Summary

The accuracy obtained in the test set is __0.78__.

Note that the script stores the presictins in a csv file. You can also check the interactive notebook to understand better the implementation.
